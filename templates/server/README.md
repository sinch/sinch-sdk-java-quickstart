# Backend application built using Sinch Java SDK to handle incoming webhooks

This directory contains a server application based onto [Sinch SDK java](https://github.com/sinch/sinch-sdk-java)

## Requirements

- JDK 8 or later (Sinch SDK Java is requiring java 8 only but client application can use latest available version)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Sinch account](https://dashboard.sinch.com)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs)

## Configuration

### Configure application settings

com.mycompany.app.Application settings are using the `SpringBoot` configuration file: [`application.yaml`](src/main/resources/application.yaml) file and enable to configure:

#### Sinch credentials
Located in `credentials` section (*you can find all of the credentials you need on your [Sinch dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com)*):
- `project-id`: YOUR_project_id
- `key-id`: YOUR_access_key_id
- `key-secret`: YOUR_access_key_secret

#### Server port
<em>Default: 8090</em>

Located in `server` section:
- port: The port to be used to listen to incoming requests. <em>Default: 8090</em>

## Usage

### Start server
1. Edit configuration file

   See above for Configuration paragraph

2. Start server locally.

   Compile and run the application as server locally.
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
### EndPoints
When server is online, declared controllers will respond to following endpoints

| Service      | Endpoint           | 
|--------------|--------------------|
| Numbers      | /NumbersEvent      |
| SMS          | /SmsEvent          |
| Verification | /VerificationEvent |
| Voice        | /VoiceEvent        |

## Use ngrok to forward request to local server

Forwarding request to same `8090` port used above:

*Note: The `8090` value is coming from default config and can be changed (see [Server port](#Server port) configuration section)*

```bash
ngrok http 8090
```

ngrok output will contains output like:
```
ngrok                                                                                                                                                                                                                          (Ctrl+C to quit)

...
Forwarding                    https://0e64-78-117-86-140.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8090

```

```
Forwarding                    https://0e64-78-117-86-140.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8090
```
